			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> Lucy's Interlude <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1920x1080 <br>This work of art was inspired by one of my best friends who composed his first original song. His creativity with audio inspired me to create a visual element of   
				how I personally experienced the song that he created. His song put me into a trance of sorts so I decided to create a loop that captures this trance feeling that I experienced. I synced the effects I was using to the
				flow of the song and that is how I managed to create the loop.
